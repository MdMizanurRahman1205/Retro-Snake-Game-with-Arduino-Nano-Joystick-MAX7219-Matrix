# Retro-Snake-Game-with-Arduino-Nano-Joystick-MAX7219-Matrix
This project brings the classic Snake Game to life using an Arduino Nano, a joystick, and two 8x8 MAX7219 LED matrix displays combined into a single 16Ã—8 playfield. The game features a smooth joystick-controlled snake, food spawning, game over detection, a start/restart button, and a blinking snake head for added flair.
